# PortfolioSite
My portfolio website

Built using ReactJS, HTML5, CSS3

Ive included all the files including the build folder, except for the node modules and the larger video files for the webiste.(They are still listed in the import section of components/projects.js so test files would be needed to be used with the same names to start/compile without errors.

To run the site locally you will need node and react installed in the root folder of the project. 

To run the build version, in terminal from the root folder run npm run build.

To run the dev version, in terminal from the root folder run npm start.
